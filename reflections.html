        This page summarizes the general education electives that I took while at Iowa State.
         Each entry lists the course name and number as well as how it has helped me to grow.
        The classes are listed in order from most recent to least. This is not an exhaustive list
        by any means.

        <h3 class="panel-title">History 201 - Introduction to Western Civilizations, Part I</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        This class covered the history of Europe from the beginning of human history to 1500.
        This included a weeklong study of Greek philosophy including Socrates, Plato, and 
        Aristotle. It made an impression on me because the Greeks believed that being able to 
        argue one's point was a trait that any responsible member of society should have. It was 
        a prerequisite to holding any power in their society, and it influenced nearly every 
        Western society that followed.

        <h3 class="panel-title">Speech Communication 212 - Fundamentals of Public Speaking</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        Very few people enjoy speech classes, and I was certainly not one of those people. Going in
        to this class, I had a lot of anxiety about public speaking. Fortunately, I had a 
        fantastic TA who helped me get past my fears. This class also taught me to form better more
        concise arguments, to reason better. This is a very important skillset that has helped me 
        in my algorithms class which requires a very methodical and logical approach.

        <h3 class="panel-title">English 314 - Technical Communication</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        In this course I learned to use Photoshop and InDesign to create professional looking 
        tutorials and documents. One of my projects was to create an informational sheet. I chose 
        to make mine about some of the more common tools found in Kali Linux. New members of one 
        of the clubs that I'm in have actually expressed interest in looking at it. Expect a link 
        on this site as soon as I find it.

        <h3 class="panel-title">Anthropology 202 - Biological Anthropology</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        Biological anthropology revolved around the evolution of humans and culminated in a unit on
        forensic anthropology. This class was the first formal education in anatomy that I 
        received. Besides the anatomy lesson, the forensic anthropology unit was a lesson in 
        detective work. This lesson helped me when I started learning about network forensics and 
        even helped my team and I to win the 2015 National Cyber Analyst Challenge.

        <h3 class="panel-title">LAS 103C - Communication Frontiers</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        This was a half-semester seminar on body language and facial expressions as they relate to
        violence. Obviously, as a software engineer I don't really deal with violent people. 
        However, this class helped me to understand micro expressions. These can be very useful 
        when giving a presentation or working in a group setting because people often hide what 
        they really feel about your ideas. If these feelings don't get addressed, team members can
        feel that they are not being heard which can create tension. Tension in groups that need 
        to work together for any period of time can lead to problems.
