    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        The ISU ISERink entails creating a virtual copy of the Iowa State University
        network for the purposes of training the internal IT department on 
        responding to cyber security threats of all kinds. Besides creating the 
        virtual environment in which this training will occur, our team is also
        working on a series of scenarios that the IT department can utilize.
        <br/>
        The technologies involved in this project include ESXI and vSphere for the
        virtualization aspect and a yet to be determined web framework which we will
        use to create a portal for the scenarios.

        The Web Development Club was formed in August of 2015. As one of the 
        founding members, I have been helping less experienced members learn to
        use git, HTML, and Bootstrap. I have also been contributing code to the
        repository on Github. As a club, we attended HackISU and spent hours
        fleshing out the initial design and coming up with plans for future
        additions.

    <div class="panel-body">
    For the past few months, I and four other Iowa State students have been preparing for a competition called the National Cyber Analyst Challenge. We all worked together as a team to learn everything we could about network forensics.<br/>
    On November 5, we flew out to Washington DC for the final round of the competition. Once there we were given the immense task of sorting through dozens of gigabytes of data in search of evidence to prove the answers to three questions that the organizers posed. And we only had three hours to do it.

    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        During my time at Iowa State, I have devoted a great deal of time to learning about wireless technologies, their uses and their weaknesses. On November 3, I presented some of my knowledge on the subject to the Information Assurance Student Group, a club dedicated to information security. I discussed the reasons that not all wireless security protocols are created equal. I also provided a tutorial on breaking into routers that use these less than secure protocols, and I cautioned my audience never to put their sole trust in the encryption used by their router.<br/>

    <div class="panel-body">
        For my ComS 309 class, my group decided to make an extensible web
        application using Django and Python with Bootstrap and Jinja templates.
        This web application helps users plan trips, parties, and meetings by
        providing a suite of widgets that do everything from helping you find a
        ride to helping you split the bill.
        <br/>
        We actually took our app for a test drive when we went on a group trip 
        to Adventureland in Des Moines. This was one of the top projects of our 
        class for the semester, and we nearly won the team spirit award as well.
        We really enjoyed working together and have discussed continuing this 
        project at a later date.

    <div class="panel-body">
        This was one of the first major projects I was involved in at Iowa State
        University. For our SE 319 course, my team and I decided to make a desktop
        application in C# and XAML that would keep track of who the user had loaned
        books or media to. It featured changeable color schemes, a favorite items
        area, and more. It was also my first experience with git, which I then
        vowed to master. I now use git on an almost daily basis.
