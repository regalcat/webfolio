        <h2 class="panel-title">2nd Annual National Cyber Analyst Challenge</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        Back for a second year, the National Cyber Analyst Challenge is an event that strives to
        develop the forensics skills of students at the senior undergraduate and graduate levels.
        Last year, our team went to the finals in Washington, D.C. and won the entire event. This
        year, we're back with a few new team members and just as excited to be participating.
        We completed Phase I of the competition on August 19th and just recently heard back 
        regarding our scores.
        We will compete in Phase III, the Finals, on October 27-28. In the mean time, we will be 
        practicing with a myriad of forensics tools and techniques in order to ensure that we give
        our very best effort at the Finals.
        <br />
        Technologies Used: LogViewer, Notepad++, Windows Event Logs

    <div class="panel-body">
    I recently ran my first ever 5K. It was tough, but well worth it for such an excellent charity.
    My high school class raised money for this charity back when we were still in school, so this
    year we got a group together to participate in the 5K. Aiming for a Cure supports children with
    cancer along with their families. It feels fantastic helping others while trying new activities.

        <h2 class="panel-title">Senior Design - Iowa State ISERink (2015-2016)</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        The ISU ISERink entails creating a virtual copy of the Iowa State University
        network for the purposes of training the internal IT department on 
        responding to cyber security threats of all kinds. Besides creating the 
        virtual environment in which this training will occur, our team is also
        working on a series of scenarios that the IT department can utilize.
        <br/>
        The technologies involved in this project include ESXI and vSphere for the
        virtualization aspect and a yet to be determined web framework which we will
        use to create a portal for the scenarios.
        <br/>
        Technologies used: ESXi, Django, Bootstrap, ISEFlow<br/>

    <div class="panel-body">
        For my ComS 309 class, my group decided to make an extensible web
        application using Django and Python with Bootstrap and Jinja templates.
        This web application helps users plan trips, parties, and meetings by
        providing a suite of widgets that do everything from helping you find a
        ride to helping you split the bill.
        <br/>
        We actually took our app for a test drive when we went on a group trip 
        to Adventureland in Des Moines. This was one of the top projects of our 
        class for the semester, and we nearly won the team spirit award as well.
        We really enjoyed working together and have discussed continuing this 
        project at a later date.

        This was one of the first major projects I was involved in at Iowa State
        University. For our SE 319 course, my team and I decided to make a desktop
        application in C# and XAML that would keep track of who the user had loaned
        books or media to. It featured changeable color schemes, a favorite items
        area, and more. It was also my first experience with git, which I then
        vowed to master. I now use git on an almost daily basis.
